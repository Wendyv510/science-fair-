<h4> Description: </h4>
 <p> The science fair website is set up for teachers/users to sign up/sign in and be able to enroll their students for the school science fair for 2020. When they sign in they are directed to a welcome page where they can choose to view all students, enroll/edit students or logout. Upon signing in there are input validations in place to ensure input is correct, or redirects them to a failure page. Once signed in they can view all the students, but are only able to edit or delete their students.     <p>
